In this first laboratory we will work with a real dataset, generate a network graph and analyze it using the Python package NetworkX. We will also introduce pandas, an excellent library to load and process datasets efficiently. A third goal of this assigment is to start familiarizing ourselves with PyTorch Geometric, a library built upon PyTorch to easily write and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for a wide range of applications related to network data. You are required to submit a report with your solutions (a single pdf file you will upload to Gradescope) including your answers and discussions, the Python code you developed as well as the corresponding outputs including figures. If you work on the (optional) analytical problem, as part of the report include a writeup of your solutions (typing is not mandatory). Due Monday February 9 via Gradescope.
